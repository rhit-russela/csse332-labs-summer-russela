## Efficiency Constraint Hints

So here's the trick. If you think about it carefully, the above problem has a
very easy but inefficient solution. By inefficient I mean that that solution
wakes up more threads than what is really needed, thus causing a lot of
busy-waiting, which is not ideal.

To earn the full credits, you must find that inefficiency and fix it. The crux
of the issue lies in the combination of rules (2) and (3) above. The key idea
is that anytime a car leaves the bridge and there are cars waiting, then at
least one car will definitely enter the bridge, and at most two cars can enter
the bridge at once (think about the possible cases that might lead to that
happening). Therefore, to solve the inefficiency, you must figure out exactly
how many cars should enter the bridge and then wake up exactly that many cars.
All other cars should remain sleeping and thus should not busy-wait at all.

The output of the more efficient solution is not going to look any different
than the output of the inefficient solution, so I will judge your code by
analyzing it for efficiency.

> Hint: You might need to make some assumptions about the priority of certain
  cars over others; feel free to do those as you see fit. Make sure to add your
  assumptions in comments in your submission file.
